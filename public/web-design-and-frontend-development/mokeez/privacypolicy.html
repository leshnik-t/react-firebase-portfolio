                    	<h2>V. Legal basis for processing</h2>
                        <p>
                        	According to the legislation in the field of personal data protection, it should be a &quote;legal basis&quote; for the use of personal information. The legal grounds are set out in the General Regulation on the Personal Data Protection (Regulation 2016/679) and the relevant national data protection legislation.
                        </p>
						<h3>Specific consent</h3>
						<p>
							There is consent when we ask you whether we can use your information for a specific purpose and you agree with it.
						</p>
						<h3>Legal obligation</h3>
						<p>
							We have a legal basis to use your information when processing is necessary to comply with a statutory or regulatory obligation.
						</p>
						<h3>Performing a contract / taking steps under your pre-contractual relationship request</h3>
						<p>
							We have reasons to use your personal information when we are in the process of entering into a contract with you or performing a contractual obligation. For example, when you use any of our services or apply to work with us.
						</p>
						<h3>Vital interests</h3>
						<p>
							We may use your personal information where the processing is necessary to protect the interests of life and health. For example, if there is a case where we need to contact someone unexpectedly or share his or her information with Emergency Service.
						</p>
						<h3>Legitimate interests</h3>
						<p>
							We have reason to use your personal information when it is reasonably necessary for us (or a third party) to do so in our (or a third party) &quot;legitimate interest&quot; (provided that the purpose for which the information is used is fair and does not have an unjustified impact on your rights). We believe that our legitimate interests include all the day-to-day activities that Galaximatic Ltd. performs with personal information.
						</p>
						<p>
							We rely on legitimate interests only when we believe that any potential impact on you (positive and negative), its degree of privacy impact, and your rights under personal data protection laws have no precedence over our (third party) interest in using your information in this way.
						</p>
						<p>
							When we use sensitive personal information, we require an additional legal basis in accordance with the legislation on the personal data protection, so we will do on the grounds of your explicit consent or other means at our disposal for the use of this type of information (for example, if you have made it publicly available, if we have to process it for employment, social security or social protection purposes, for your vital interests or, in some cases, if it is of public interest in doing so).
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paddingSection">
                    	<h2>VI. How we protect the security of your information</h2>
                        <p>
                        	We apply technical and organizational measures to ensure that your personal information is protected. For example, our online contact forms are always encrypted and our network is protected and routinely monitored. We limit access to information on a &quote;need-to-know&quote; basis and undertake appropriate measures to ensure that our team members are aware that such information is used only in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We regularly review who has access to the information that we have, in order to guarantee that your information is only available to suitably trained staff and contractors.
                        </p>
					</div>
					<div class="paddingSection">
                    	<h2>VII. How long your information is stored</h2>
                        <p>
                        	Galaximatic Ltd. applies specific criteria to determine how long your information will be stored, specified on the basis of legal and operational considerations, taking into account the guidelines of the Commission for Personal Data Protection. The principle is that we store it for a period no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
                        </p>
						<p>
							We store your collected personal information, when we have an ongoing legitimate business need for that (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with the applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). When we do not have a legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will erase or anonymize it, and if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backups), then we will securely store your personal information and will isolate it from any other processing until erasure become possible.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="paddingSection">
                    	<h2>VIII. Sharing your information with other oranizations</h2>
                        <p>
                        	We will only use your information for the purposes for which we have collected it. Under no circumstances will we sell or share your personal information with any third party for its purposes, and you will not receive marketing communications from any other organization as a result of sharing your data with us.
                        </p>
						<p>
							We will only share your data for the following purposes:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Third-party suppliers and subcontractors who may process personal data on our behalf: We may need to share your information with hosting providers and other services that help us to provide our services. These providers will only act upon our instructions, be subject to prior verification and will assume contractual obligations containing strict data protection clauses. We strive to ensure that these third parties will only use personal data for legitimate purposes in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
							<li>Where we are legally bound: We will perform such requests when the disclosure of information is mandatory by law. In addition, we will ensure the sharing of such information by signing, as far as possible, specific agreements with the organization concerned or through case-by-case check aiming to ascertain that the request and the disclosure of the information are lawful.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							When we use external data processing companies on our behalf, we perform a complete comprehensive verification of these companies and conclude a contract that sets out our expectations and requirements, especially with regards to the way they manage the personal data collected or to which they have access.
						</p>
						<p>
							In some cases, we may decide to use the services of a supplier outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), which means that your personal information is transferred, processed and stored outside the EEA. You should be aware that in general the legal protection of personal information in non-EEA countries may not be equivalent to the level of protection granted in the EEA. However, we undertake steps to introduce appropriate precautionary measures to protect your personal information when processed by the provider, such as using the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission. By providing us your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storage or processing outside EEA.

						<p>
							If we collect and process your personal information on the basis of your consent, you have the right at any time to withdraw your consent. The withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of the consent-based processing prior to its withdrawal or the processing of your personal information on any other legal basis.
						</p>

							You have the right to request the erasure of personal data relating to you, restriction of the processing or to object to the processing of your personal data.
